    "Customer churn is one of the most pressing challenges for subscription-based businesses. In the telecommunications sector, churn directly impacts revenue, customer lifetime value, and operational efficiency. The aim of this project is to predict which customers are most likely to stop using the service (i.e., churn) using a machine learning model. This will allow the business to proactively retain high-risk customers through personalized interventions.\n"

    "- Loss of recurring revenue\n",
    "- Increased cost of acquiring new customers\n",
    "- Possible damage to brand reputation if the churn results from a poor customer experience\n",

    "\n",
    "Machine learning is well-suited for solving the churn prediction problem because:\n",
    "- It automates the detection of complex, non-linear patterns in large customer datasets\n",
    "- It handles high-dimensional data better than manual analysis\n",
    "- It can continuously learn and improve over time as new data comes in\n",
    "- Churn is inherently a **binary classification** task — customers either churn (1) or do not (0) — making it ideal for classification algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Using ML will enable predictive decision-making that goes beyond descriptive analytics.\n"
