# Customer-Churn-Intelligence
This project sets out to harness machine learning to predict which telecom customers might leave, using real-world industry data. By exploring different models, we hope to uncover the most important reasons behind customer churn. Ultimately, the goal is to equip businesses with practical, data-backed strategies for keeping customers longer.

# Business Objective
For telecom providers, losing customers hurts the bottom line. Early predictions make it possible to reach out and win back at-risk users before it’s too late. My work goes beyond simple predictions—it classifies customers by churn risk, highlights the strongest drivers of that risk, and delivers clear, actionable recommendations to help companies craft more effective retention plans.
